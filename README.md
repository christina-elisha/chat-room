# chat-room in Node.js
chat room with WebSockets,
client-side, server-side code

How It Works:

# Node.js  # express.js  # websocket.js package installed

# % node server.js
# open a browser to localhost:/3000

WebSocket connection: The client (browser) establishes a WebSocket connection to the server.

Broadcasting messages: When a client sends a message, the server broadcasts it to all connected clients.

Real-time updates: All clients receive messages in real-time without the need to refresh the page.

User name assignment: All clients receive a unique user name

# chat-room
a real-time chat room application using JavaScript and WebSockets involves both client-side and server-side code

How It Works:

WebSocket connection: The client (browser) establishes a WebSocket connection to the server.

Broadcasting messages: When a client sends a message, the server broadcasts it to all connected clients.

Real-time updates: All clients receive messages in real-time without the need to refresh the page.

User name assignment: All clients receive a unique user name
